       ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER

       This case arises out of a soured business relationship between a franchisor and franchisee.

Plaintiff Three Dog Bakery, LLC alleges that Defendants J.L.E.T. Enterprises SWF, LLC, Joseph

Naughton, and Lynette Naughton breached the franchise agreement and misappropriated

Plaintiff’s trade secrets when they continued operating a pet bakery in Sarasota, Florida, after their

franchise agreement was terminated.

       Now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order.

ECF No. 3. Plaintiff requests a temporary restraining order enjoining and restraining Defendants

from violating the franchise agreement’s noncompete provision and using its confidential

information, licensed marks, equipment, and processes.

       After carefully reviewing the motion and the existing record, the Court holds Plaintiff has

not met its burden for the Court to issue a temporary restraining order. The request for temporary

restraining order is DENIED.

                                            Background

       Plaintiff’s allegations are detailed in its Verified Complaint, motion, and suggestions in

support of the motion, all of which the Court has carefully reviewed. Compl., ECF No. 1; Mot.

be repeated here.

                    Standard for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order

        A temporary restraining order is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not

be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.” Mazurek v.

Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (quotation omitted). The Eighth Circuit applies the same

standards to a request for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order. See S.B.

McLaughlin & Co. v. Tudor Oaks Condo. Project, 877 F.2d 707, 708 (8th Cir. 1989).

        The factors this Court considers in any such request are: (1) the threat of irreparable harm

to the movant; (2) the balance between this harm and any injury that granting the injunction will

inflict on the non-moving party; (3) the likelihood that the moving party will prevail on the merits;

and (4) the public interest. Phelps-Roper v. Nixon, 509 F.3d 480, 484 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing

Dataphase Sys. Inc. v. CL Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc)). No single factor

is determinative; they “must be balanced to determine whether they tilt towards or away from

granting” the injunction. Noodles Dev., LP. v. Ninth St. Partners, LLP, 507 F. Supp. 2d 1030,

1034 (E.D. Mo. 2007).

                                            Discussion

   I.      Plaintiff has not demonstrated a threat of irreparable harm.

        To demonstrate a sufficient threat of irreparable harm, the moving party must show that

there is no adequate remedy at law; that is, that an award of damages cannot compensate the

movant for the harm. See id. at 1036–37. Irreparable harm must be certain and imminent such

“that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.” Iowa Utils. Bd. v. F.C.C., 109 F.3d

418, 425 (8th Cir. 1996). Possible or speculative harm is not sufficient. See Local Union No. 884,



                                                 2

        Case 4:25-cv-00442-DGK           Document 8        Filed 06/16/25      Page 2 of 5
United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum, & Plastic Workers of Am. v. Bridgestone / Firestone, Inc., 61 F.3d

1347, 1355 (8th Cir. 1995). “Failure to show irreparable harm is an independently sufficient

ground upon which to deny [a temporary restraining order].” Watkins Inc. v. Lewis, 346 F.3d 841,

844 (8th Cir. 2003).

         Here, Plaintiff’s Verified Complaint lacks “specific facts . . . show[ing] that immediate and

irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result” if a temporary restraining order is not granted. See

Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(A).       Specifically, the Verified Complaint states only that “[u]pon

information and belief, Defendants continue to operate a Three Dog Bakery in Sarasota, Florida at

the Location despite having had their 2021 Franchise Agreement terminated.” Compl. ¶ 44. But

a single allegation made on information and belief provides no basis for the extraordinary and

drastic remedy of an ex parte temporary restraining order.

         Further, Plaintiff terminated the franchise agreement on May 18, 2025, and then waited a

month to seek emergency injunctive relief. This delay undercuts Plaintiff’s claim of urgency. See

Ng v. Bd. of Regents, 64 F.4th 992, 997 (8th Cir. 2023) (noting that “an unreasonable delay in

moving for the injunction can undermine a showing of irreparable harm”).              This concern is

reinforced by the timing of this case, which was filed shortly after the Court granted a preliminary

injunction in a separate matter involving Plaintiff and another franchisee. The sequence of events

suggests judge shopping rather than a genuine need for urgent relief.

         As such, the first factor weighs against issuing a preliminary injunction.

   II.      Plaintiff has shown the balance of harms favors issuing a TRO.

         Plaintiff argues that without the issuance of a preliminary injunction the risk to them is

great. Plaintiff also contends that Defendants will not suffer any harm because “injunctive relief

will merely require Defendants to comply with contractual obligations that they knowingly and

voluntarily agreed to.” Suggestion in Supp. at 18. While the second factor slightly favors Plaintiff,

it carries minimal weight in the analysis.

   III.      Plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits.

          To demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits, a movant does not need to show that it

ultimately will succeed on its claims, only that the movant’s prospects for success is “at least . . .

sufficiently likely to support the kind of relief it requests.” Noodles Dev., 507 F. Supp. 2d at 1034

(emphasis added) (quotation omitted). That is, the movant need only show “a fair chance of

prevailing.” Phelps-Roper, 509 F.3d at 485 (quotation omitted).

          There is ample evidence in the record that the parties had a franchise agreement that

addressed: (1) royalty and marketing fees; (2) use of confidential information and distinctive

markings; and (3) operating a competing business. There are also allegations that suggest

Defendants have violated one or more of these provisions. As such, Plaintiff has at least a fair

chance of prevailing on at least some of its claims.

   IV.       The public interest does not weigh in Plaintiffs’ favor.

          The Court finds the public interest does not favor either granting or denying the request for

a temporary restraining order. Thus, this factor does not weigh in favor of either side.

   V.        Plaintiffs have not carried their burden.

          After balancing the four factors, the Court holds Plaintiff has not clearly shown entitlement

to the extraordinary and drastic remedy of an ex parte temporary restraining order. See Noodles

Dev., 507 F. Supp. 2d at 1034.

                                              Conclusion

          Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order is DENIED. The Court withholds

ruling on Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction until the issue is fully briefed.
