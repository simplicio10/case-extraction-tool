                                           I.          INTRODUCTION

                    President Trump’s deployment of California’s National Guard, without the

             consent of California’s Governor and in violation of the statute on which the

             President relies, is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic. It is inconsistent

             with one of our Nation’s founding principles that freedom depends on the

             subordination of the military to civilian authority. By calling forth troops when there

             is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law

             enforcement is fully able to execute the laws, the President flouts the vision of our

             Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the

             constitutional rights of all Americans at risk.

                             II.    IDENTITY AND INTERESTS OF AMICI

                    The identity and interests of the Amici States are detailed in their

             contemporaneously filed Motion for Leave to file this brief.

                                                III.    ARGUMENT

             A.     Fear of Military Rule Compelled the Framers to Embed State Control of
                    the Militias in the Constitution

                    “Civilian rule is basic to our system of government.” Bissonette v. Haig,

             776 F.2d 1384, 1387 (8th Cir. 1985), on reh’g, 800 F.2d 812 (8th Cir. 1986), aff’d,

             485 U.S. 264 (1988). Civilian authority is necessary to uphold our liberties, because

             the “use of military forces to seize civilians can expose civilian government to the

             threat of military rule and the suspension of constitutional liberties.” Id. Military

                                                          1
(8 of 21), Page 8 of 21     Case: 25-3727, 06/15/2025, DktEntry: 21.2, Page 8 of 21




             force threatens “vital Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights,” “chill[s] the exercise” of

             the rights to “speak freely and to vote,” and can “create the atmosphere of fear and

             hostility which exists in territories occupied by enemy forces.” Id. Accordingly, “a

             traditional and strong resistance of Americans to any military intrusion into civilian

             affairs . . . has deep roots in our history.” Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 15 (1972).

             President Trump’s unconstitutional deployment of the National Guard threatens this

             tradition and the freedoms it protects.

                    1.    Our Founders Sought to Prohibit Military Rule

                    One of the Founders’ “well-established purpose[s]” was to keep the military

             subordinate to civil authority. Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 30 (1957); see also Duncan

             v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304, 320 (1946). Indeed, King George III’s deployment

             of British soldiers in the colonies galvanized a revolution. Starting in 1768, the King

             quartered British troops in Boston “to intimidate the local populace.” Reid, 354 U.S.

             at 27. In 1770, Redcoats deployed to enforce unpopular tax acts murdered five

             protestors in the Boston Massacre, sparking our Revolution.1

                    The Founders thus embraced a commitment to civilian control, even as they

             faced down a war. In drafting the Articles of Confederation, the Continental

             Congress placed primary reliance on state militias to provide security in

             emergencies, while eschewing the role of federal troops.2 They further provided that

             each state’s militia was limited to those functions needed for the “defense” of the

             state.

                      Under the Articles, “[t]he executive and military officials who . . . found it

             necessary to utilize the armed forces to keep order in a young and turbulent nation,

             did not lose sight . . . that existing civilian government . . . [was] not to be interfered

             with by the exercise of military power.” Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. at 320. For example,

             in 1786, when insurrectionists armed themselves to attack federal facilities in what

             became known as Shays’ Rebellion, Massachusetts’ governor deployed the militia

             to assist civil law enforcement. But the governor decreed the militia was “to consider

             [themselves] in all [their] military offensive operations constantly as under the

             direction of the civil officer[.]” 3

                      2.    The Constitution Enshrines a Deliberate Balance of State and
                            Federal Military Control

                      When the Framers met to craft a new Constitution in 1787, the document they

             created reflected their concerns about military subversion of civilian rule, while

             acknowledging that some national military might be necessary to supplement the

             standing army under the command of a civilian Commander-in-Chief, and gave

             Congress, not the President, authority to raise, support, and regulate the armed

             forces. U.S. Const., art. II, § 2, cl. 1; art. I, § 8, cls. 12-14. Meanwhile, the Framers

             preserved a primary role for “the Militia of the several States.” Id., art. II, § 2.

             Congress was empowered “[t]o provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the

             Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions” and “[t]o provide for

             organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them

             as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States

             respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the

             Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress[.]” Id., art. I, § 8,

             cls. 15-16. The President was assigned the role of “Commander in Chief of . . . the

             Militia of the several States” only “when called into the actual Service of the United

             States[.]” Id., art. II, § 2.

                    Thus, Congress was given the power to provide for calling state militias into

             national service—but only in cases of invasion, insurrection, or breakdown in federal

             law. And when called forth, the President would exercise authority as Commander-

             in-Chief. Otherwise, state militias remained entirely within the states’ control. See

             Houston v. Moore, 18 U.S. 1, 50 (1820) (Story, J., concurring) (“[T]he power here

             given to Congress over the militia[] is of a limited nature, and confined to the objects

             specified in these clauses; . . . in all other respects, and for all other purposes, the

             militia are subject to the control and government of the State authorities.”).

                    In this vein, Congress passed the Calling Forth Act in 1792, 1 Stat. 264, § 1

             (1792), which authorized the President to deploy state militias “whenever the United

             States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation

             or Indian tribe . . . to repel such invasion.” Id. In the event of “insurrection,” the

             President was empowered to federalize state militias only “on application of the

             legislature” of the state facing the insurrection, “or of the executive (when the

             legislature cannot be convened).” Id., § 2. The Act also authorized the President to

             deploy militias without a state’s request, but only if “the laws of the United States

             shall be opposed, or the execution thereof obstructed . . . by combinations too

             powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the

             powers vested in the [federal] marshals.” Id. In    1807,    Congress     passed    the

             Insurrection Act, permitting the President to deploy regular military forces in the

             same circumstances as state militias. 2 Stat. 443 (1807).

                    With this, the balance of state and federal authority was set, and has since

             remained essentially unchanged, with the President’s authority to deploy militias for

             domestic law enforcement carefully conscribed.

             B.     Presidents Have Carefully Avoided Domestic Deployment of the Militias
                    Unless Absolutely Necessary

                    Since 1792, the President has only used militia in domestic law enforcement

             as “a last resort,” when a state requested help to quell an insurrection, when

             necessary to enforce a federal court order, or when state and local law enforcement

             are unable to enforce the law.4 Between 1792 and June 2025, Presidents relied on

             the Calling Forth and Insurrection Acts approximately thirty times to engage

             National Guards in domestic law enforcement.5 Presidents have called the National

             Guard forth to respond to armed uprisings like the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 and

             the Brooks-Baxter War in 1874; riots like the Colfax Massacre in 1873 and the Los

             Angeles Riots in 1992; the Civil War and post-war reign of terror by the Ku Klux

             Klan; crippling labor strife like the Colorado Coalfield War of 1914 and the Battle

             of Blair Mountain in 1921; and states’ refusals to comply with desegregation orders

             and protect civil rights protestors in Little Rock in 1957 and Selma in 1965.6

                    Meanwhile, Congress periodically adjusted the guardrails to ensure the

             President’s ability to respond to emergencies, while protecting the delicate

             state-federal balance. During Reconstruction, President Grant deployed armed

             forces on multiple occasions to support fragile Reconstruction governments and

             address the threats of the Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist groups.7 In this unique

             epoch, extensive military involvement was indispensable in reconstructing a

             shattered nation and protecting the rights of newly freed slaves.8

                    In 1876, however, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes lost the popular vote, but

             won the electoral vote only after promising to withdraw federal troops from the

             former Confederacy. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act

             to restrict any further use of the armed forces for domestic law enforcement.9

             As presently codified, the Act provides:

                    Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly
                    authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any
                    part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the
                    Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall
                    be fined . . . or imprisoned[.]

             18 U.S.C. § 1385. After the experience of Reconstruction, the Posse Comitatus Act

             reestablished the antebellum balance. It sharply limited military involvement in

             civilian affairs, while preserving some flexibility for the President to use armed

             forces in extraordinary circumstances.

                    Congress next spoke in 1903. Following the Spanish-American War,

             Congress passed the Militia Act of 1903—known as the Dick Act—to improve the

             readiness and training of the state militias.10 The Dick Act created the modern

             National Guard and set forth the circumstances under which they may be federalized.

             See Perpich v. Dep’t of Def., 496 U.S. 335, 342 (1990). As Representative Charles

             Dick, then-Chairman of the Committee on Militia explained, the President could not

             call up the National Guard at “his arbitrary pleasure” but only in specific enumerated

             circumstances.11 He noted, “[i]t was the hereditary fear of standing armies, as a

             menace to liberty in time of peace, which lead the framers of the Constitution to

             provide that the militia should always remain a militia of the States.”12

                    Consistent with this unbroken tradition of restricting the President’s authority

             to call up the National Guard, Section 4 of the Dick Act included the provision that

             would later become 10 U.S.C. § 12406. As initially passed, it provided:

                    That whenever the United States is invaded, or in danger of invasion
                    from any foreign nation, or of rebellion against the authority of the
                    Government of the United States, or the President is unable, with the

                    other forces at his command, to execute the laws of the Union in any
                    part thereof, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth, for a period
                    not exceeding nine months, such number of the militia of the State or
                    of the States or Territories or of the District of Columbia as he may
                    deem necessary to repel such invasion, suppress such rebellion, or to
                    enable him to execute such laws, and to issue his orders for that purpose
                    to such officers of the militia as he may think proper.

             Perhaps in response to the experience of the Civil War during which some pro-

             slavery Union states declined to send forth their militias,13 this early version of the

             statute did not include any role for state governors. But just five years later, before

             Section 4 was ever invoked, Congress amended the statute to add the requirement

             that when the President has need to nationalize the Guard in the face of invasion,

             rebellion, or inability to enforce the laws, he must “issue his orders for that purpose,

             through the governor of the respective State or Territory, or through the commanding

             general of the militia of the District of Columbia, from which State, Territory, or

             District such troops may be called.”14 In 1956, when the Dick Act was recodified

             into Title 10, the statute was amended into its current form15:

                    Whenever-
                        (1) the United States, or any of the Commonwealths or possessions,
                    is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation;

                        (2) there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority
                    of the Government of the United States; or

                        (3) the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws
                    of the United States;

                       the President may call into Federal service members and units of the
                    National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary
                    to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws.
                    Orders for these purposes shall be issued through the governors of the
                    States or, in the case of the District of Columbia, through the
                    commanding general of the National Guard of the District of Columbia.

                    In the hundred-plus years Section 12406 has been on the books, it has only

             been invoked twice. In 1916, after Pancho Villa attacked the United States in an

             ongoing border dispute, U.S. Army forces chased him into Mexico. With the Army

             drawn away, other Mexican forces attacked undefended towns in Texas, leading

             President Wilson to call up National Guard units to defend against any further

             incursions.16

                    Section 12406 was next invoked 54 years later, when President Nixon called

             upon the Guard to deliver mail during a Postal Service Strike. Exec. Order No.

             11519, 35 Fed. Reg. 5003 (March 23, 1970). The strike had stopped mail delivery

             entirely in New York, despite federal law “requir[ing] that the business of the Post

             Office Department, including the expeditious processing and delivery of the mail,

             be regularly carried on.” Id. Because he was “unable solely with the regular forces”

             to carry out these laws, President Nixon declared a national emergency,

             see Proclamation 3972, and federalized the Guard to deliver mail.17

                    In the 55 years since, Section 12406 has lain dormant.

                    As this history makes clear, President Trump’s invocation of Section 12406

             to deploy armed National Guard soldiers and entangle them in protests that local law

             enforcement is able to manage—over the objection of California’s Governor—is

             unprecedented in our history. It runs contrary to our nation’s unbroken tradition of

             restraint in using the armed forces to conduct law enforcement. It undermines the

             historical and constitutionally enshrined balance between state and local authority.

             And it threatens the civil liberties of all Americans. While our leaders have long

             recognized that the armed forces might sometimes be necessary to respond to

             emergencies, they have only been used as a last resort, and always with an eye

             toward respecting the primacy of civil law enforcement and state control of the

             militias.

                    For good reason. Under Appellants’ theory, a president could make

             unfounded claims of voter fraud and then send federalized National Guard troops to

             seize voting machines based on his determination that state election officers are

             unable to enforce federal election law. Or a president could determine states were

             insufficiently enforcing gun safety laws and send the National Guard house-to-house

             to inspect Americans’ weapons and seize any that could arguably be used in a

             rebellion. This cannot be, and the Court should make clear that President Trump’s

             invocation of Section 12406 undermines one of our Nation’s founding principles:

             that freedom depends on the subordination of the military to civilian authority.
