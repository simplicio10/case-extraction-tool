BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD OF
ILLINOIS, et al.,

                       Defendants.

                                      OPINION & ORDER

         This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion to Proceed Under Pseudonym. (Doc.

2). For the following reasons, the Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiffs

are ORDERED to refile their Complaint, identifying them by their first names and last initials,

within seven (7) days.

I.       BACKGROUND

         Briefly, Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act

(“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. § 1132 et seq. (Doc. 1). As alleged, Plaintiff Jane Doe is an employe of

AT&T Services, Inc. and is a participant in AT&T Umbrella Benefit Plan No. 3 (the “Plan”). (Id.

at ¶ 1). Her dependent son, John Doe, is a beneficiary of the Plan. (Id. at ¶ 2). He suffers from

and has been treated for mental illness for many years. (Id. at ¶ 9). In 2024, John Doe’s condition

deteriorated, and doctors recommended in-patient treatment. (Id. at ¶¶ 9–10 (also stating John Doe

continues to be treated in some capacity for mental illness today)). Jane Doe and Defendant

BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois (“BCBSI”), the claims administrator for medical benefits

provided to participants and beneficiaries of the Plan, evaluated treatment facilities together. (Id.
  Case: 2:25-cv-00608-DRC-KAJ Doc #: 3 Filed: 06/11/25 Page: 2 of 7 PAGEID #: 19




at ¶¶ 5, 11). Jane Doe concluded treatment at Linder Center of Hope in Cincinnati (“LCH”) was

the best option. (Id. at ¶ 11).

        LCH “operates as a private pay facility and does not accept payments from insurers.” (Id.

at ¶ 12 (alleging patients pay fees in advance then seek reimbursement from their insurers or benefit

plans)). It is also an out-of-network provider under the Plan. (Id. ¶ 13). BCBSI representatives

told Jane Doe that John Doe’s treatment would be deemed medically necessary, and Jane Doe’s

out-of-pocket cost would not exceed $15,000. (Id. at ¶¶ 14–17). Ultimately, John Doe’s treatment

at LCH lasted less than four weeks. (Id. at ¶ 18). The treatment cost $47,200, which Jane Doe

paid in full. (Id. at ¶¶ 19–20). When Jane Doe submitted the LCH bill for reimbursement, BCBSI

reimbursed her for “far less than the amounts it had promised.” (Id. at ¶¶ 21–22). Jane Doe

appealed the amount to BCBSI, but her appeal was denied. (Id. at ¶¶ 23–26).

        Plaintiffs now seek, among other things, payment of the out-of-pocket costs they incurred

in excess of the Plan’s out-of-pocket limitation. (Id. at 9; see also id. at ¶¶ 27–65 (bringing claims

of equitable estoppel, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and the Mental Health Parity

Act, 29 U.S.C. § 1185a)). Plaintiffs also seek to proceed under pseudonyms. (Doc. 2). The Court

considers that request here.

II.     STANDARD

        Generally, a complaint must state the names of all the parties. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a). But,

in certain circumstances, the Court “may excuse [parties] from identifying themselves.” Doe v.

Porter, 370 F.3d 558, 560 (6th Cir. 2004). “In exercising its discretion, a court must balance the

public’s common law right of access to court proceedings against the interests of litigants in

nondisclosure.” Malibu Media, LLC v. Doe, No. 2:15-CV-2519, 2015 WL 12698036, at *1 (S.D.

Ohio Aug. 26, 2015) (citing In re Polemar Constr. Ltd. P’ship, 23 F. App’x. 423, 425 (6th Cir.



                                                  2

2001). To determine whether a party’s privacy interests outweigh the presumption in favor of

openness, the Sixth Circuit directs district courts to consider the following:

       (1) whether the [party] seeking anonymity [is] suing to challenge governmental
       activity; (2) whether prosecution of the suit will compel the [party] to disclose
       information ‘of the utmost intimacy’; (3) whether the litigation compels [a party]
       to disclose an intention to violate the law, thereby risking criminal prosecution; and
       (4) whether the [party is a child].

Porter, 370 F.3d at 560 (citing Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir. 1981)). “It is also

relevant to consider whether the defendants are being forced to proceed with insufficient

information to present their arguments against the plaintiff’s case.” Citizens for a Strong Ohio v.

Marsh, 123 F. App’x 630, 636 (6th Cir. 2005).

III.   DISCUSSION

       According to Plaintiffs, John Doe’s substantial privacy interests outweigh the presumption

of disclosure of his identity. (Doc. 2). And by extension, his mother, as “John Doe’s privacy

interests are inextricably intertwined with his mother’s.” (Id. at 4). Plaintiffs cite the absence of

prejudice, as well as the second and fourth Porter factors, to support their Motion. The Court

considers the arguments in reverse.

       Beginning with the fourth Porter factor, “[p]laintiffs who are children are especially

vulnerable and courts routinely grant them ‘a heightened protection’” via grants of pseudonymity.

Doe v. Southfield Pub. Sch., No. 24-10760, 2024 WL 1526084, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 8, 2024);

see also Doe v. Mechanicsburg Sch. Bd. of Educ., 518 F. Supp. 3d 1024, 1027 (S.D. Ohio 2021)

(“Courts frequently grant protective orders to minors who challenge governmental conduct.”). The

same is true of parents of minor children when the child could be identified after revelation of a

parent’s identity. Southfield Pub. Sch., 2024 WL 1526084 at *2.




                                                  3
  Case: 2:25-cv-00608-DRC-KAJ Doc #: 3 Filed: 06/11/25 Page: 4 of 7 PAGEID #: 21




        Plaintiffs concede that John Doe was not a child at the time of his hospitalization at

LCH―he was 19 years old. (Doc. 2 at 3). Still, Plaintiffs argue that at the time, “he was likewise

not yet fully an adult.” (Id. (citing laws restricting the sale of cigarettes, alcohol, and firearms to

people under the age of 21)). Though a creative argument, the fact remains that John Doe was not

a child during his hospitalization nor when he initiated this lawsuit. Plaintiffs do not provide any

caselaw saying the Court may consider this factor met when the plaintiff at issue is not, in fact, a

child. Therefore, this factor does not weigh in Plaintiffs’ favor.

        The second Porter factor―whether the litigation will compel Plaintiffs to disclose

information of the utmost intimacy―requires more nuanced deliberation. Courts in this Circuit

have noted examples of information of the utmost privacy concern include “matters of a sensitive

and highly personal nature, such as birth control, abortion, homosexuality or the welfare rights of

illegitimate children or abandoned families.” Doe v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., of Am., No. 3:22-CV-

212-DCLC-DCP, 2022 WL 20686965, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Sept. 20, 2022) (quoting G.E.G. v.

Shinseki, No. 1:10-CV-1124, 2012 WL 381589, at *2 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 6, 2012)). While none of

those are at play here, Plaintiffs argue that John Doe’s “life-threatening mental health condition”

and hospitalization is information of the utmost intimacy. (Doc. 2 at 3). And disclosing either

Doe’s identity would result in stigmatization of both John Doe and other litigants with mental

illnesses. (Id.).

        Up front, Plaintiffs’ argument does not fit neatly into the confines of the second Porter

factor. Stigmatization of mental illness on a grand scale does not necessarily translate to John

Doe’s illness being “information of the utmost intimacy.” And in this Circuit, stigmatization of a

mental illness, even on an individual level, has generally not been enough to push the needle in

analogous circumstances. Cf. Doe v. Carson, No. 19-1566, 2020 WL 2611189, at *2 (6th Cir.

May 6, 2020) (upholding a district court’s finding that “concerns about stigma and scrutiny from

prospective employers do not involve ‘information of the utmost intimacy’” in a case brought

under the Americans with Disabilities Act)); Koe v. Univ. Hosps. Health Sys., Inc., No. 22-3952,

2024 WL 1048184, at *2 (6th Cir. Mar. 8, 2024); see also UNUM Life Ins. Co., of Am., 2022 WL

20686965, at *3 (noting plaintiffs must generally justify pseudonym requests with more than

“generalized and unspecific fears.”).

       At the same time, the Court does not discount that in very limited cases, certain factual and

legal allegations related to a party’s medical history implicate weighty privacy concerns. For

example, citing “significant privacy concerns,” this Court allows claimants filing cases challenging

a decision of the Commissioner of Social Security―which, by nature, involve detailed discussion

of sensitive medical information―under their first name and last initial only. S.D. Ohio General

Order 22-01. Those same “significant privacy concerns” debatably exist here, where John Doe’s

history of “life-threatening” mental illness and circumstances surrounding his in-patient treatment

will undoubtedly be at the forefront of this litigation. Cf. Doe v. Hartford Life & Acc. Ins. Co.,

237 F.R.D. 545, 550 (D.N.J. 2006) (comparing an ERISA plaintiff with severe, treatment-resistant

bipolar disorder to litigants who receive abortion care or an HIV diagnosis); Smith v. United

Healthcare Ins. Co., No. 18-CV-06336-HSG, 2019 WL 3238918, at *7 (N.D. Cal. July 18, 2019)

(allowing an ERISA plaintiff to proceed anonymously “to preserve her privacy in the sensitive

area of her mental health diagnosis and treatment”).

       What’s more, the Porter factors are not exclusive considerations. See, e.g., Doe v. Fedex

Ground Package Sys., Inc., No. 3:21-CV-00395, 2021 WL 5041286, at * (M.D. Tenn. Oct. 29,

2021); Doe v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 694 F. Supp. 3d 1040, 1043 (M.D.

Tenn. 2023); Plaintiff v. Wayne State Univ., No. 20-CV-11718, 2021 WL 243155, at *7 (E.D.



                                                 5

Mich. Jan. 29, 2021). To this end, the Court also finds relevant the public’s interest in “ensuring

that cases like [John Doe’s] are adjudicated and the rights of mental illness sufferers are

represented fairly.” Doe v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 176 F.R.D. 464, 468 (E.D. Pa. 1997)

(warning that “unscrupulous insurance companies may be encouraged to deny valid claims with

the expectation that [individuals with mental illness] will not pursue their rights in court” should

the plaintiff be denied leave to proceed under a pseudonym). The Court also considers that

Defendants likely will not suffer any prejudice if Plaintiffs are allowed to proceed under a

pseudonym because, by their own admission, Plaintiffs would promptly identify themselves to

Defendants’ counsel. (Doc. 2 at 4). See Citizens for a Strong Ohio, 123 F. App’x at 636.

       On balance, this case presents a close call. Plaintiffs arguably have demonstrated only one

Porter factor. But also weighing in their favor is the public’s interest in the adjudication of this

case and the lack of prejudice to Defendants. In the end, the Court finds a middle ground

sufficiently balances Plaintiffs’ privacy interests with the presumption in favor of open judicial

proceedings. While they may not proceed as “Jane and John Doe,” Plaintiffs will be permitted to

proceed under their first names and last initial. Cf. Kurt W. v. Gartner, Inc., No. 2:24-CV-00504,

2025 WL 589977 (D. Utah Feb. 24, 2025). The Court underscores that this decision strikes the

appropriate balance between openness and privacy for this particular ERISA action. Not all

ERISA actions will present the same factual or legal scenario justifying even the partial relief the

Court allows here. Cf. UNUM Life Ins. Co., of Am., 2022 WL 20686965, at *4 (noting that even

if the Court were to consider out of circuit precedent allowing an ERISA plaintiff to proceed under

a pseudonym, the plaintiff had not shown “her fears regarding her injuries carry similar stigma as

someone with psychiatric disorders.”). In other words, this opinion offers a measured outcome

justified by the relevant considerations―not a one-size-fits-all solution.

       Plaintiffs are ORDERED to refile their Complaint which conforms to this Order within

the next seven (7) days. Additionally, all parties to this action are GRANTED leave to, in any

filing in this case, redact Plaintiffs’ names so only their first names and last initials are revealed.

Further, because Defendants have not been served, should they wish the Court to reevaluate this

decision, they may file a brief to that end within fourteen (14) days of counsel entering an

appearance.

       As a final note, the Court reminds Plaintiffs of the other avenues available to them to

address additional privacy concerns, such as seeking protective orders or moving to seal filings

from the public docket under Shane Group, Inc. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, 825 F.3d

299 (6th Cir. 2016).

IV.    CONCLUSION

       For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Proceed Under Pseudonym (Doc. 2) is

GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Plaintiffs are ORDERED to refile their Complaint,

identifying them by their first names and last initials, within seven (7) days.
